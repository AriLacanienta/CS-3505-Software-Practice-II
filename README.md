These projects were all coded by me using c++ in an ubuntu container


## Assignment 01 - 1D Celular autonoma
/A1/CA.cpp

### Overview
This project generates celular autonoma based on rules specified by an 8 digit binary number. Generation size and number of generations is also editable.

Running the program with 126, 129, and 117 has some pretty cool results.

## Assignment 02 - Facade
/A2/spiralPDF

### Overview
This project generates a pdf that displays a user's text in the shape of a spiral.

Uses the Facade design pattern. I'm very interested to start getting into Gang of Four stuff. I originally stumbled accross the GoF when I was studying parse trees for my SQR language server.

### Assignment 03 - A Trie
/A3/TrieTest
